# Journey log

One entry per session, appended by the `session-journal` skill. Raw transcripts
(if kept) live in `docs/journey/raw/`, which is local only and gitignored.

## Session 01 — Feasibility review & foundations · 2026-10-16
- **Where:** Claude chat (cloud session linked to Sam's PC) · **Model/effort:** Opus / default
- **Goal:** Check the project is feasible at $0, list what's needed, and set up the project's working method.
- **Did:**
  - Reviewed the goals against the four SDLC layers (spec hub, context/MCP, execution, orchestration/verification).
  - Confirmed a free stack is viable; estimated 10–12 focused Claude Code sessions (~1–2 weeks within Pro limits).
  - Created project skills `next-step` (next task, model/effort, same vs fresh session) and `session-journal`.
  - Drafted CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP, design direction, handoff for session 02.
- **Decisions:** Combine the LMS build and the SDLC demo into one project · public repo · roles employee/manager/admin · internal audience and users · working name "Away" · draft "postcards from time off" visual direction · fresh project-specific skills (not reused from Little Sylly Games) · journal = summarised entries in repo, raw transcripts local-only.
- **Lessons:**
  - "Orchestration & automated verification" = CI/CD with agents plugged in: an issue triggers the agent, it opens a PR, CI and an AI review check it, a human approves the merge, then it deploys.
  - "MCP" means two things here: tools Claude uses while building (GitHub, Supabase, Calendar) vs the app exposing its own MCP server.
  - Claude chat queues and triggers work; Claude Code (local or in GitHub Actions) executes it.
  - The Chrome extension wasn't reachable from the cloud chat session, so account checks moved to CLI auth checks in Claude Code.
  - ccusage only sees Claude Code sessions, so chat sessions like this one must be noted manually.
- **AI vs human:** AI did the review, plan, skills and docs. Sam created accounts, enabled connectors, and made the scope/role/visibility decisions.
- **Effort:** ~30 min wall-clock · chat session (not tracked by ccusage)
